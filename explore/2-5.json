  "Surah": "Al-Baqarah",
  "Verse": "2:5",
  "Arabic Text": "أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَىٰ هُدًى مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ",
  "Transliteration": "Ula'ika 'ala hudan min rabbihim, wa ula'ika hum al-muflihun",
  "English Translation": "These are upon guidance from their Lord. These are the successful.",
  "Linguistic Analysis": "Grammatically, the demonstrative pronoun “ula’ika” (these) is repeated twice in verse 2:5: “These are upon guidance… These are the successful.” This repetition is not redundant; it emphasises two distinct blessings. Guidance is the means — the light that shows the path. Success (falah) is the end — reaching Paradise and attaining Allah’s pleasure. It comes from another word “Alafa” which is related to word “Fallah” which means time of harvest after hard work, i.e. this success is after long hardship. You can be guided but not succeed if you turn away from hardship; also you cannot succeed without being guided. But these people have both.\n\nThe phrase “‘ala hudan min rabbihim” (upon guidance from their Lord) uses the preposition “‘ala”, which in Arabic idiom suggests firmness and stability, like someone mounted firmly on a camel. It means they are not just touching guidance — they are established upon it, moving forward with confidence. And it is “from their Lord”, not from their own intellect or culture — showing that true guidance is a divine gift, not a human achievement.\n\nThe word “muflihun” (successful) comes from “falah”, which originally meant to split the earth with a plough — the farmer cuts through hard soil to plant seeds, trusting that rain will come. So the successful person is one who endures hardship in this life for the harvest of the next. He succeeds not because he avoids difficulty, but because he uses it to grow.",
  "Context of Revelation": "See previous ayat.",
  "Reflections": "And the promise — “These are upon guidance… These are the successful” — is not for the perfect, but for those who strive to embody these traits. You don’t need to have memorised every scripture; you need to accept them all as from Allah. You don’t need to see the Hereafter; you need to live as if you do.",

  "Surah": "Al-Baqarah",
  "Verse": "2:15",
  "Arabic Text": "اللَّهُ يَسْتَهْزِئُ بِهِمْ وَيَمُدُّهُمْ فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ",
  "Transliteration": "Allahu yastahzi'u bihim wa yumadduhum fi tughyanihim ya'mahoon",
  "English Translation": "It is Allah who ridicules them, and leaves them bewildered in their transgression.",
  "Linguistic Analysis": "But then comes the divine reversal: “Allahu yastahzi’u bihim” — “It is God who ridicules them.” This is one of the most profound statements in the Quran. How can Allah — the Most Majestic — “mock”? The scholars explain that this is but divine retribution in kind. Just as they played with truth, Allah allows them to be played with by their own illusions. He grants them respite, lets them think they are clever, and leads them deeper into error — until their “cleverness” becomes their trap. This is the ultimate irony: the mocker becomes the mocked by the One whose truth he ridiculed. The next phrase — “wa yumadduhum fi tughyanihim ya‘mahoon” — deepens the tragedy. “Yumadduhum” means He prolongs them, gives them respite, extends their time. But this is not mercy; it is a form of punishment. As the Quran says elsewhere, “We only grant them respite so they may increase in sin” (Al-Imran: 178). Their extra time is not a chance to repent — it is rope to hang themselves, because their hearts are already sealed. “Tughyan” means transgression, rebellion, going beyond all limits — like Pharaoh claiming, “I am your most high Lord.” And “ya‘mahoon” means they wander blindly, confused, lost in darkness. The word “‘amh” implies a state of bewilderment so deep they cannot find their way out, like a man lost in a desert with no stars to guide him this is thus blindness of heart unlike blindness of eyes (which is amia). Their intellect, once sharp enough to deceive, is now clouded by their own lies, so hypocrite they think they are free but they are in illusion of freedom. Grammatically, the structure moves from their action (“they ridicule”) to divine response (“Allah ridicules them”) to consequence (“He extends them in transgression, they wander”). It is a complete cycle of self-destruction.",
  "Context of Revelation": "These verses were revealed in Medina about Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Salul and his faction — the chief hypocrites who outwardly professed Islam but secretly plotted against the Prophet (peace be upon him). They would greet believers with “Assalamu alaykum”, pray in the mosque, and even fight in battles — but in private, they mocked the Companions, called the Quran “fables of the ancients”, and conspired with the Quraysh and Jews. Ibn Abbas, Qatadah, and Ibn Mas‘ud all confirmed that “their devils” refers to their fellow hypocrites and leaders of disbelief. There is a weak narration about a specific incident where they pretended to support the Muslims in front of Abu Bakr and Umar, then mocked them in secret — but the general meaning is clear: their duality was a consistent pattern. The Prophet was fully aware of them, yet he treated them with outward grace, because Allah had not commanded him to expose them publicly. Their exposure came through revelation — so that the believers would recognise their ways, and so that the hypocrites themselves would know that Allah sees what they hide.",
  "Reflections": "These verses are a warning about the deadliest form of spiritual disease: living a double life. The hypocrite is not the one who sins openly — he can repent. The hypocrite is the one who wears the mask of piety while his heart mocks truth. He may lead prayers, give lectures, or run Islamic organisations — but in private, he laughs at those who take faith seriously. But the greater warning is this: Allah’s mockery is not laughter — it is abandonment. When Allah “mocks” someone, He lets them believe their own lies. He gives them success in this world, admiration from people, and confidence in their schemes — while their hearts grow darker and their fate more sealed. This is the state of those who use religion for power, status, or profit, thinking they are outsmarting everyone — when in reality, they are the ones being led to ruin. And “ya‘mahoon” — they wander — is the final stage. They lose all moral compass. Right and wrong blur. They justify every sin. They call oppression justice, disbelief enlightenment, and betrayal loyalty. And they do not even realise they are lost. Every time you read these verses, ask yourself: Do I say one thing in public and another in private? Do I respect the sincere believer, or do I mock him in my heart as “too strict”? Am I using Islamic identity for worldly gain — while my heart is empty of love for Allah? Because the greatest danger is not to be seen as a hypocrite — it is to become one without knowing it. And remember: Allah does not need to strike you down to punish you. Sometimes, His greatest punishment is to let you think you are winning — while you are already lost.",

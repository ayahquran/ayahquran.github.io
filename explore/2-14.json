  "Surah": "Al-Baqarah",
  "Verse": "2:14",
  "Arabic Text": "وَإِذَا لَقُوا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا قَالُوا آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَوْا إِلَىٰ شَيَاطِينِهِمْ قَالُوا إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِئُونَ",
  "Transliteration": "Wa idha laqaw alladhina amanu qalu amanna, wa idha khalaw ila shayatinihim qalu inna ma'akum, innama nahnu mustahzi'un",
  "English Translation": "And when they come across those who believe, they say, ‘We believe’; but when they are alone with their devils, they say, ‘We are with you; we were only ridiculing.’",
  "Linguistic Analysis": "These verses expose the double life of the hypocrites — their public face and their private truth. The word “laqa” (they meet) implies a close, intentional encounter — not a chance passing, but a deliberate interaction with believers. In that moment, they say, “Amana” — “We believe” — using the exact words of faith, mimicking the believers perfectly. But the moment they are alone — “khalaw ilaa shayatinihim” — they reveal their true allegiance. The phrase “khalaw ilaa” is powerful. “Khalwa” means seclusion, intimacy, and the preposition “ilaa” (to/toward) suggests movement — they actively seek out their “shayatin”. Now, “shayatin” here does not necessarily mean jinn devils, though it includes them. As Ibn Mas‘ud explained, it refers to their leaders in disbelief — the ringleaders of hypocrisy, like Abdullah ibn Ubayy, or fellow conspirators who share their inner corruption. The Prophet (peace be upon him) confirmed this when he said, “Humans have devils too,” meaning evil companions who incite one another to sin. In that private circle, they say: “Inna ma‘akum” — “Indeed, we are with you.” This is not just agreement; it is solidarity in disbelief. And then they add: “Innama nahnu mustahzi’un” — “We were only ridiculing.” The word “mustahzi’un” comes from “huzu’”, which means mockery, derision, treating something sacred as a joke. They did not just pretend — they laughed at the believers behind their backs, treating faith as a game to be played for social advantage.",
  "Context of Revelation": "These verses were revealed in Medina about Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Salul and his faction — the chief hypocrites who outwardly professed Islam but secretly plotted against the Prophet (peace be upon him). They would greet believers with “Assalamu alaykum”, pray in the mosque, and even fight in battles — but in private, they mocked the Companions, called the Quran “fables of the ancients”, and conspired with the Quraysh and Jews. Ibn Abbas, Qatadah, and Ibn Mas‘ud all confirmed that “their devils” refers to their fellow hypocrites and leaders of disbelief. There is a weak narration about a specific incident where they pretended to support the Muslims in front of Abu Bakr and Umar, then mocked them in secret — but the general meaning is clear: their duality was a consistent pattern. The Prophet was fully aware of them, yet he treated them with outward grace, because Allah had not commanded him to expose them publicly. Their exposure came through revelation — so that the believers would recognise their ways, and so that the hypocrites themselves would know that Allah sees what they hide.",
  "Reflections": "These verses are a warning about the deadliest form of spiritual disease: living a double life, a believer is not required to show his Iman but a munafiq always do show-off. The hypocrite is not the one who sins openly — he can repent. The hypocrite is the one who wears the mask of piety while his heart mocks truth. He may lead prayers, give lectures, or run Islamic organisations — but in private, he laughs at those who take faith seriously. But the greater warning is this: Allah’s mockery is not laughter — it is abandonment. When Allah “mocks” someone, He lets them believe their own lies. He gives them success in this world, admiration from people, and confidence in their schemes — while their hearts grow darker and their fate more sealed. This is the state of those who use religion for power, status, or profit, thinking they are outsmarting everyone — when in reality, they are the ones being led to ruin. And “ya‘mahoon” — they wander — is the final stage. They lose all moral compass. Right and wrong blur. They justify every sin. They call oppression justice, disbelief enlightenment, and betrayal loyalty. And they do not even realise they are lost. Every time you read these verses, ask yourself: Do I say one thing in public and another in private? Do I respect the sincere believer, or do I mock him in my heart as “too strict”? Am I using Islamic identity for worldly gain — while my heart is empty of love for Allah? Because the greatest danger is not to be seen as a hypocrite — it is to become one without knowing it. And remember: Allah does not need to strike you down to punish you. Sometimes, His greatest punishment is to let you think you are winning — while you are already lost.",

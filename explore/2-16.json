  "Surah": "Al-Baqarah",
  "Verse": "2:16",
  "Arabic Text": "أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ اشْتَرَوُا الضَّلَالَةَ بِالْهُدَىٰ فَمَا رَبِحَت تِّجَارَتُهُمْ وَمَا كَانُوا مُهْتَدِينَ",
  "Transliteration": "Ula'ika alladhina ishtaraw al-dalalata bil-huda, fa ma rabihat tijaratuhum wa ma kanu muhtadin",
  "English Translation": "Those are they who have bartered error for guidance; but their trade does not profit them, and they are not guided.",
  "Linguistic Analysis": "This verse delivers a devastating economic metaphor: the hypocrites have engaged in a trade, but it is the worst deal imaginable. The verb “ishtaraw” comes from “shira’”, which literally means “to buy”, but here it is used metaphorically for exchange — not a commercial transaction, but a moral and spiritual choice. They did not literally purchase misguidance with money; they traded away guidance in exchange for error. As the Arabs would say, “He exchanged knowledge for ignorance,” meaning he gave up something precious for something worthless. The structure “ishtaraw al-dalalata bil-huda” — “they bought misguidance with guidance” — is intentionally ironic. In normal trade, you give something of lesser value to receive something of greater value. But here, they gave the higher (guidance) to receive the lower (misguidance). It is like selling a diamond for a pebble and thinking you’ve gained. The preposition “bi” (with) shows what was paid — guidance was the price they paid to acquire error. Now, “dalalah” (error, misguidance) is not mere ignorance. It is active deviation from the right path, confusion, loss of direction, and spiritual ruin. It includes both the state of being lost and the act of choosing falsehood over truth. In contrast, “huda” (guidance) is the clear, straight path that leads to Allah’s pleasure — not just knowledge, but divine enablement to walk the path. Then comes the divine verdict: “fa ma rabihat tijaratuhum” — “so their trade did not profit them.” The word “tijarah” (trade) is used deliberately — the hypocrites thought they were making a smart deal: keep the social benefits of Islam without its demands, gain the protection of the Muslim community while secretly siding with its enemies. But Allah declares: this trade brought no profit. In fact, it brought total loss. “Rabihat” implies increase, gain, abundance — and here it is negated absolutely: no return, no benefit, no reward. And the final phrase — “wa ma kanu muhtadin” — “and they were not guided” — muhtad is when you do struggle and you get something, so here they are not even struggling to get hidayah and it seals their fate. This is not just about the past; it is a permanent state. They are not among the guided, because they rejected guidance when it was offered. The use of the past tense “kanu” indicates that their opportunity has passed — not because Allah refused them, but because they chose error and Allah confirmed them in it. Grammatically, the verse uses commercial language to expose spiritual bankruptcy. In the Quran, trade is often used positively — “Allah has purchased from the believers their lives and wealth in exchange for Paradise” (At-Tawbah: 111). But here, the trade is inverted: they sold Paradise for illusion.",
  "Context of Revelation": "This verse continues the description of the hypocrites in Medina — particularly Abdullah ibn Ubayy and his followers, who outwardly professed Islam but inwardly clung to tribal pride, disbelief, and alliance with enemies. They had access to the purest guidance — the Prophet (peace be upon him), the Quran, the company of the Companions — yet they chose misguidance. Why? Because guidance required humility, sacrifice, and submission — and they preferred control, status, and convenience. Ibn Abbas explained: “They exchanged disbelief for faith” — meaning they had the chance to embrace true belief but chose to hold onto falsehood. Ibn Mas‘ud said: “They took misguidance and abandoned guidance.” Qatadah lamented: “You have seen them go from guidance to misguidance, from unity to division, from security to fear, and from Sunnah to innovation.” This shows that their loss was not just spiritual — it was social, psychological, and communal. The verse also responds to their self-deception. They thought they were “reformers” (2:11), “wise” (2:13), and “clever” (2:14). But Allah strips away the illusion: you didn’t gain — you lost everything.",
  "Reflections": "This verse is a mirror for every soul that compromises truth for comfort. How many today “barter guidance for error” by: Choosing popularity over principle, Preferring silence over speaking truth, Trading halal livelihood for haram ease, Abandoning prayer for career, Following culture instead of Quran? The tragedy is not that they sinned — repentance is always open. The tragedy is that they thought they were winning. They called their compromise “wisdom”, their silence “diplomacy”, their betrayal “realism”. But in the sight of Allah, it was a losing trade. And the phrase “their trade does not profit them” is eternal. No amount of worldly success — wealth, fame, power — can compensate for the loss of guidance. On the Day of Judgment, they will have no capital, no profit, no share in Paradise. Their entire life was a bad investment. But the final words — “and they are not guided” — are the deepest wound. It is possible to be surrounded by truth — mosques, Quran, scholars — and still be un-guided, because guidance is a gift from Allah that requires a receptive heart. The hypocrites had all the signs, yet their hearts were sealed by their own choices.",

 { "Surah": "Al-Baqarah", "Verse": "2:11", "Arabic Text": "وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ لَا تُفْسِدُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ قَالُوا إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُصْلِحُونَ", "Transliteration": "Wa idha qila lahum la tufsidu fil-ardi qalu innama nahnu muslihun", "English Translation": "And when it is said to them, ‘Do not make trouble on earth,’ they say, ‘We are only reformers.’", "Linguistic Analysis": "These verses expose a defining trait of the hypocrites: they rebrand corruption as reform. The Arabic word munafiq (or 'hypocrite') is derived from nafaqa, which refers to two-faced behavior and insincerity. Here the response 'We are only reformers' is a rhetorical device used to mask malicious intent and to justify actions that cause harm.", "Context of Revelation": "These verses were revealed in Medina addressing the hypocrites among the Ansar and some who outwardly joined the Muslim community while secretly undermining it. They outwardly professed support but their actions betrayed their true intentions, and the verses respond to that discrepancy.", "Reflections": "This is the second sign of a hypocrite: they cause corruption yet present themselves as innocent or reformers. The verses remain relevant: in every age some wrap destructive behavior in the language of 'reform'. The passage urges careful attention to actions and consequences rather than merely accepting reassuring words.", "Similar Verses": [ "7-56", "26-183", "28-77", "29-63" ] }
